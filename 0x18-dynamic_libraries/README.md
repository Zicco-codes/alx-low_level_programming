README for 0x18 - C Dynamic Libraries
Introduction
Welcome to the 0x18 project on C Dynamic Libraries! This repository contains examples and information about dynamic libraries in the C programming language. Dynamic libraries, also known as shared libraries, provide a way to share code among multiple programs, reducing redundancy and promoting code reuse.

Contents
libholberton.so: A sample dynamic library containing various functions.
holberton.h: Header file with function prototypes for the dynamic library.
1-create_dynamic_lib.sh: A script to compile and create the dynamic library.
100-operations.so: An additional dynamic library demonstrating library dependencies.
main.c: A sample program using the dynamic libraries.
